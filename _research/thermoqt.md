## What is ThermoQT
ThermoQT is a project funded from Next Generation EU, in the context of the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan, 
M4C2 investment 1.2. The project was awarded a Seal Of Excellence from the ERC as a MSCA proposal and later financed trough this 
particular scheme. 
ThermoQT is an individual project of Lorenzo Buffoni, however it benefits from numerous local and international collaborations
as the coauthors of the papers reported below demonstrate. 

## What are its goals
The ThermoQT project is a comprehensive initiative with the overarching goal of advancing our understanding of energy dissipation in quantum systems, developing tools for energetical benchmarking, and designing energy-efficient quantum devices and protocols.
In the initial phase, the project focuses on characterizing the diverse sources of energy dissipation and irreversibility such as those related to quantum measurements and inherent energetic losses in driven quantum systems. In general, we aim to look at different types of quantum dynamics, which are relevant for quantum technologies, and characterize sources of dissipation, energy consumption and irreversibility from a fundamental standpoint.
Another objective of the project is to create practical tools, primarily in the form of software packages, developed in Python for good integration in the open-source community of quantum simulation packages, for the purpose of energetical benchmarking of quantum devices. These tools will enable researchers within the scope of ThermoQT and the broader scientific community to quantify the energetical footprint of quantum devices.
The last objective of ThermoQT is to leverage the accumulated knowledge and tools implemented to design quantum gates and protocols that operate with minimal energy consumption. These protocols could come at a tradeoff with respect to the quality of the result or to the time or resources employed for the protocol,  quantifying these tradeoffs between energy consumption and other metrics will be the ultimate factor that will make these energy efficient protocols useful for the broader community of quantum technologies.
In summary, ThermoQT is a multifaceted project with the ultimate aim of enhancing our knowledge of quantum energy dissipation, providing valuable tools for benchmarking quantum technologies and contributing to the development of energy-efficient quantum devices and protocols.
