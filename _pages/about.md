I'm a researcher at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Florence, Italy. 
Here's some small website that serves as a repository for all my work and to comply with EU projects that require to have a website. 
On the left you can find my social profiles, above various sections with things that you might or might not find interesting.

WARNING: This is a super beta version of the site for me to get used to this...
